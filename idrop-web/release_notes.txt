**added a 'no data available' display in the browse details panel instead of double notifications using the 'growler' pop up.  Errors tend to happen in the tree
giving a pop-up, and then a secondary error would appear doing an AJAX call to the secondary div to build the details.  Now the tree error will put up the pop-up, and 
the secondary exception is muted.

**work in progress, adding additional logging

*[#1057] callUpdateTags javascript error

in an operation and no default rule exists on iRODS.

**Handle no default resource errors with a user message
