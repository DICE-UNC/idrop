==Bug Fixes==

*[#1028] upload mac opera shows javascript exception in idrop web v2
** added a 'no data available' display in the browse details panel instead of double notifications using the 'growler' pop up.  Errors tend to happen in the tree
giving a pop-up, and then a secondary error would appear doing an AJAX call to the secondary div to build the details.  Now the tree error will put up the pop-up, and 
the secondary exception is muted.

*[#1042] Chinese char set displayes invalid characters 
**work in progress, adding additional logging
