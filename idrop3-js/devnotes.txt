This is the javascript and angular template project for idrop3.  This has been separated from the grails back-end portion of the application, allowing a pure javasript dev workflow. The app uses grunt to automate
the building and testing of the javascript code, and creation of distribution assets that are then placed in the grails 'idrop3' app structure.  This distribution workflow
can be automated by running grunt, through the use of the grunt watch hooks.
