==News==

This is the iDrop desktop transfer manager client.  iDrop runs in the system tray of your favorite operating system, and can manage transfers between your computer and iRODS, and manage data once in iRODS.

iDrop also automates synchronization between your desktop and iRODS.  There is an initial local -> iRODS backup capability, with automatic version of files within iRODS.  Other modes are in development

GForge for iDrop-swing is at:  [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/irodsidrop/]]

==Requirements==

-iDrop depends on Java 1.6+
-iDrop is built using Maven

iDrop-swing uses Maven for dependency management.  See the pom.xml file for references to various dependencies.
